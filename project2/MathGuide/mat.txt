1. Commutative Law of Addition of Matrix: Matrix multiplication is commutative. This says that, if A and B are matrices of the same order such that A + B is defined then A + B = B + A.

Proof:  Let A = [aij]m × n and B = [bij]m × n

Let A + B = C = [cij]m × n and B + A = D = [dij]m × n

Then, cij = aij + bij

              = bij + aij , (by using the definition of addition of matrices)

              = dij

Since C and D are of the same order and cij = dij then, C = D.

i.e., A + B = B + A. This completes the proof.




2. Associative Law of Addition of Matrix: Matrix addition is associative. This says that, if A, B and C are Three matrices of the same order such that the matrices B + C, A + (B + C), A + B, (A + B) + C are defined then A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C.

Proof: Let A = [aij]m × n ,B = [bij]m × n and C = [cij]m × n

Let B + C = D = [dij]m × n , A + B = E = [eij]m × n , A + D = P = [pij]m × n , E + C = Q = [qij]m × n

Then, dij = bij + cij , eij = aij + bij , pij = aij + dij and qij = eij + cij

Now, A + (B + C) = A + D = P = [pij]m × n

and (A + B) + C = E + C = Q = [qij]m × n

Therefore, P and Q are the matrices of the same order and

              pij = aij + dij = aij + (bij + cij)

                   = (aij + bij) + cij , (by the definition of addition of matrices)

                    = eij + cij

                    = qij

Since P and Q are of the same order and pij = qij then, P = Q.

i.e., A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C. This completes the proof.


3. Existence of Additive Identity of Matrix: Let A be the matrix then, A + O = A = O + A

Therefore, ‘O’ is the null matrix of the same order as the matrix A

Proof: Let A = [aij]m × n and O = [0]m × n

Therefore, A + O = [aij] + [0]

                          = [aij + 0]

                          = [aij]

                           = A

Again, O + A = [0] + [aij]

                     = [0 + aij]

                     = [aij]

                     = A

Note: The null matrix is called the additive identity for the matrices.


4. Existence of Additive Inverse of Matrix: Let A be the matrix then, A + (- A) = O = (- A) + A

Proof: Let A = [aij]m × n

Therefore, - A = [- aij]m × n

Now, A + (- A) = [aij] + [- aij]

                       = [aij + (- aij)]

                       = [0]

                        = O

Again (- A) + A = [- aij] + [aij]

                       = [(-aij) + aij]

                       = [0]

                       = O

Therefore, A + (- A) = O = (- A) + A

Note: The matrix – A is called the additive inverse of the matrix A.

If X and Y are two m × n matrices (matrices of the same order) and k, c and 1 are the numbers (scalars). Then the following results are obvious.

I. k(A + B) = kA + kB

II. (k + c)A = kA + cA

III. k(cA) = (kc)A

IV. 1A = A


Proof: Let A = [aij] and B = [bij] are two m × n matrices.




I. k(A + B) = k([aij] + [bij])

                 = k[aij + bij], (by using the definition of addition of matrices)

                 = [k(aij + bij)], (by using the definition of scalar multiplication of matrices)

                 = [kaij + kbij]

                 = [kaij] + [kbij]

                 = k[aij] + k[bij]

                 = kA + kB

Therefore, k(A + B) = kA + kB (proved).


II. (k + c)A = (k + c) [aij]

                  = [(k + c) (aij)], (by using the definition of scalar multiplication of matrices)

                  = [kaij + caij]

                  = [kaij] + [caij]

                  = k[aij] + c[aij]

                  = kA + cA

Therefore, (k + c)A = kA + cA (proved).


III. k(cA) = k(c[aij])

              = k[caij], (by using the definition of scalar multiplication of matrices)


              = [k(caij)]

              = [(kc) aij], (by using the definition of scalar multiplication of matrices)

              = (kc) [aij]

              = (kc)A

Therefore, k(cA) = (kc)A (proved).


IV. 1A = 1[aij]

          = [1 ∙ aij]

          = [aij]

          = A

Therefore, 1A = A (proved).
